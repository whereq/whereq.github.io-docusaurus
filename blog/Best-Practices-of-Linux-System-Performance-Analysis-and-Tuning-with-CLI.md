## Introduction

Monitoring and tuning Linux system performance is crucial for maintaining the health and efficiency of your infrastructure. Command line tools like `top`, `htop`, `iotop`, `sar`, `ps`, `free`, `vmstat`, and `netstat` provide powerful capabilities for analyzing and optimizing system performance. This article provides a comprehensive guide to the best practices of using these tools, covering various scenarios such as checking CPU and memory usage, monitoring processes, and troubleshooting real production issues.

## Basic System Monitoring

### <a name="check-cpu-usage"></a> Check CPU Usage

To check CPU usage, use the `top` command:

```bash
top
```

This command displays real-time CPU and memory usage, along with a list of running processes.

### <a name="check-memory-usage"></a> Check Memory Usage

To check memory usage, use the `free` command:

```bash
free -h
```

This command displays the total, used, and free memory in a human-readable format.

### <a name="check-disk-io"></a> Check Disk I/O

To check disk I/O, use the `iostat` command:

```bash
iostat -x 1
```

This command displays detailed I/O statistics, including read and write rates.

### <a name="check-network-traffic"></a> Check Network Traffic

To check network traffic, use the `iftop` command:

```bash
iftop -i eth0
```

This command displays real-time network traffic on the `eth0` interface.

## Process Monitoring

### <a name="list-running-processes"></a> List Running Processes

To list all running processes, use the `ps` command:

```bash
ps aux
```

This command displays a detailed list of all running processes.

### <a name="check-process-status"></a> Check Process Status

To check the status of a specific process, use the `ps` command with the process ID (PID):

```bash
ps -p <PID> -o pid,ppid,cmd,%cpu,%mem,state
```

This command displays the status of the process with the specified PID.

### <a name="kill-a-process"></a> Kill a Process

To kill a process, use the `kill` command with the process ID (PID):

```bash
kill <PID>
```

This command sends a termination signal to the process with the specified PID.

## Advanced Performance Tuning

### <a name="top"></a> Top

To monitor system performance in real-time, use the `top` command:

```bash
top
```

This command provides a dynamic view of system resources and running processes.

### <a name="htop"></a> Htop

To monitor system performance with a more user-friendly interface, use `htop`:

```bash
htop
```

This command provides a colorful and interactive view of system resources and running processes.

### <a name="iotop"></a> Iotop

To monitor disk I/O in real-time, use the `iotop` command:

```bash
iotop
```

This command displays real-time disk I/O statistics for running processes.

### <a name="sar"></a> Sar

To collect and report system activity, use the `sar` command:

```bash
sar -u 1 5
```

This command collects CPU usage statistics every second for 5 seconds.

<a name="troubleshooting-real-production-issues"></a>
## Troubleshooting Real Production Issues

### <a name="high-cpu-usage"></a> High CPU Usage

To identify processes causing high CPU usage, use `top` or `htop`:

```bash
top
```

Sort processes by CPU usage by pressing `P`.

### <a name="high-memory-usage"></a> High Memory Usage

To identify processes causing high memory usage, use `top` or `htop`:

```bash
top
```

Sort processes by memory usage by pressing `M`.

### <a name="high-disk-io"></a> High Disk I/O

To identify processes causing high disk I/O, use `iotop`:

```bash
iotop
```

This command displays real-time disk I/O statistics for running processes.

### <a name="network-latency"></a> Network Latency

To diagnose network latency, use `ping` and `traceroute`:

```bash
ping google.com
traceroute google.com
```

These commands help identify network latency and routing issues.
