This guide provides a detailed overview of Kubernetes concepts, examples, use cases, installation YAML examples, and visual representations of the architecture. 

<a name="cluster"></a>
## Cluster
A **Kubernetes Cluster** is a group of nodes (machines) that host and manage containerized applications. Each cluster has at least one master node, which controls the state of the cluster, and multiple worker nodes.

### Example
A cloud-based cluster with one master node and multiple worker nodes in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

### Use Case
An ideal setup for running a production microservices application with high availability.

#### YAML Structure for Cluster Creation
```yaml
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kind: Cluster
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
  - role: worker
  - role: worker
  - role: worker
```

---

<a name="node"></a>
## Node
A **Node** is a single machine within a Kubernetes cluster, capable of running one or more pods.

### Example
In a cloud environment, each node could be a virtual machine instance.

### Use Case
Nodes distribute workloads across the infrastructure.

#### YAML Snippet
The node configuration is usually specified by the cluster management tool (e.g., GKE or EKS) rather than in YAML, as it pertains to the infrastructure layer.

---

<a name="pod"></a>
## Pod
A **Pod** is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, which can contain one or more containers.

### Example
A pod running a web server container and a logging container.

### Use Case
Running tightly coupled applications together within the same lifecycle.

#### YAML Structure for Pod
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: web-server-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: web-server
    image: nginx
  - name: logger
    image: fluentd
```

---

<a name="deployment"></a>
## Deployment
A **Deployment** is a Kubernetes object for managing a group of identical pods. It provides capabilities like rolling updates and rollback.

### Example
A deployment with three replicas of a web server pod.

### Use Case
Maintaining a stable version of an application by managing pod replicas.

#### YAML Structure for Deployment
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.17.4
```

---

<a name="service"></a>
## Service
A **Service** provides a stable endpoint for accessing a set of pods.

### Example
A service that exposes an application to the public internet.

### Use Case
Load balancing traffic to an application across multiple pods.

#### YAML Structure for Service
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: web
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

---

<a name="ingress"></a>
## Ingress
**Ingress** manages external access to services, typically using HTTP.

### Example
An ingress with rules to route traffic to different services based on URL paths.

### Use Case
Routing `/api` to backend services and `/static` to frontend services on the same domain.

#### YAML Structure for Ingress
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com

      paths:
      - path: /api
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: api-service
            port:
              number: 80
      - path: /static
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: static-service
            port:
              number: 80
```
