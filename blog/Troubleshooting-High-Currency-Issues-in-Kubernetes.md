# Pod Restart `CrashLoopBackOff` Loop Due to High Concurrency

---

<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction

In a Kubernetes cluster environment, a business operation involving extensive configuration distribution (lasting several hours or more) led to repeated restarts of Calico pods. This article details the troubleshooting process, focusing on identifying the root cause and implementing a solution.

<a name="problem-background"></a>
## Problem Background

During a high-concurrency operation, Calico pods in the Kubernetes cluster began to restart repeatedly.

```bash
[root@node02 ~]# kubectl get pod -n kube-system -owide | grep node01
calico-kube-controllers-6f59b8cdd8-8v2qw   1/1     Running            0          4h45m   10.10.119.238    node01   <none>           <none>
calico-node-b8w2b                          1/1     CrashLoopBackOff   43         3d19h   10.10.119.238    node01   <none>           <none>
coredns-795cc9c45c-k7qpb                   1/1     Running            0          4h45m   177.177.237.42    node01   <none>           <none>
...
```

## Analysis Process

Upon observing the `CrashLoopBackOff` state of the pods, the first step was to use `kubectl describe` to gather more information.

```bash
[root@node02 ~]# kubectl describe pod -n kube-system calico-node-b8w2b
...
Events:

```

The events indicated that the liveness probe was failing due to a connection timeout.

## Investigating the Issue

Manual execution of the health check command revealed slow response times, which were significantly higher than the usual millisecond-level response.

```bash
[root@node01 ~]# time curl -i http://localhost:9099/liveness
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Date: Tue, 15 Jun 2021 06:24:35 GMT
real    0m1.012s
user    0m0.003s
sys     0m0.005s
```

Logs from Calico's bird, confd, and felix components did not show any apparent errors. Checking the port status indicated that it was listening correctly.

```bash
[root@node02 ~]# netstat -anp | grep 9099
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:9099          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1202/calico-node    
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:9099          127.0.0.1:56728         TIME_WAIT   -                   
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:56546         127.0.0.1:9099          TIME_WAIT   -
```

<a name="tcp-connection-timeout"></a>
## TCP Connection Timeout

Given the connection timeout error, the TCP connection state was observed.

```bash
[root@node01 ~]# netstat -na | awk '/^tcp/{s[$6]++}END{for(key in s) print key,s[key]}'
LISTEN 49
ESTABLISHED 284
SYN_SENT 4
TIME_WAIT 176
```

The `top` command showed that the business Java process was consuming high CPU, peaking at over 2000%.

```bash

## Understanding CPU Load

Checking the total number of CPU cores and comparing it with the load average and CPU usage indicated that the load was not excessively high.

```bash
[root@node01 ~]# cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "physical id" | sort | uniq | wc -l
48
[root@node01 ~]# cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "cpu cores" | uniq
cpu cores: 1
```

Given the high concurrency, the issue was likely related to the TCP connection setup. Understanding the TCP connection phases helped pinpoint the problem.

<a name="kernel-parameter-tuning"></a>
## Kernel Parameter Tuning

The issue was traced to the `SYN_SENT` phase of TCP connections. Adjusting kernel parameters related to TCP connections resolved the problem.

### TCP State Transition Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    CLOSED -->|Client sends SYN| SYN_SENT
    SYN_SENT -->|Server responds with SYN+ACK| SYN_RECV
    SYN_RECV -->|Client sends ACK| ESTABLISHED
    ESTABLISHED -->|Connection closed by either party| FIN_WAIT_1
    FIN_WAIT_1 -->|ACK received| FIN_WAIT_2
    FIN_WAIT_2 -->|FIN received| TIME_WAIT
    TIME_WAIT -->|Timeout| CLOSED
    FIN_WAIT_1 -->|FIN received| CLOSING
    CLOSING -->|ACK received| TIME_WAIT
    SYN_RECV -->|Server sends FIN| LAST_ACK
    LAST_ACK -->|Client sends ACK| CLOSED
```

### Adjusting Kernel Parameters

```bash
[root@node01 ~]# cat /etc/sysctl.conf 
...
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 32768
net.core.somaxconn = 32768

[root@node01 ~]# sysctl -p
...
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 32768
net.core.somaxconn = 32768
```

After applying these changes, the health check commands executed without delay, and the pods returned to normal.

```bash
[root@node01 ~]# time curl -i http://localhost:9099/liveness
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Date: Tue, 15 Jun 2021 14:48:38 GMT
real    0m0.011s
user    0m0.004s
sys     0m0.004s
```

## Conclusion

This case study highlights the importance of understanding and tuning kernel parameters in high-concurrency scenarios. By adjusting parameters related to TCP connection handling, the issue of repeated pod restarts due to high CPU load and connection timeouts was resolved. This approach can be applied to similar issues in Kubernetes environments to ensure stable and efficient operation.
