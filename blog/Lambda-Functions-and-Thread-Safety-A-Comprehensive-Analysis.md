## 🔍 Understanding Thread Safety

### What is Thread Safety?
A function or object is **thread-safe** if it can be safely called or accessed from multiple threads simultaneously without causing data corruption, race conditions, or inconsistent state.

### Key Threats to Thread Safety:
1. **Race Conditions**: Multiple threads accessing/modifying shared data
2. **Mutable Shared State**: Functions modifying shared mutable objects
3. **Non-atomic Operations**: Operations that aren't indivisible
4. **Side Effects**: Functions with external effects beyond their return value

## 📊 Lambda Thread Safety Analysis

### Scenario 1: **Pure Lambda Functions** ✅ (Thread-Safe)
```python
import threading
from typing import List

# Pure lambda - NO shared state, NO side effects
pure_lambda = lambda x: x * 2
pure_lambda2 = lambda a, b: a + b
pure_lambda3 = lambda s: s.upper()

def test_pure_lambda():
    """Pure lambdas are thread-safe because they're stateless."""
    results = []
    
    def worker(x):
        result = pure_lambda(x)
        results.append(result)
    
    threads = []
    for i in range(10):
        t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(i,))
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()
    
    for t in threads:
        t.join()
    
    # All threads produce deterministic results
    print(f"Results: {sorted(results)}")  # Always [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
```

**Characteristics of thread-safe lambdas:**
- No access to non-local variables
- No modification of external state
- No I/O operations
- No calls to non-thread-safe functions
- Deterministic output based only on inputs

### Scenario 2: **Lambda with Captured Mutable Variables** ❌ (NOT Thread-Safe)
```python
import threading
import time
from typing import List

# ❌ DANGER: Lambda capturing and modifying shared mutable state
def unsafe_counter_example():
    counter = 0  # Mutable integer
    results = []  # Shared mutable list
    
    # Lambda captures 'counter' and modifies it
    increment = lambda: (
        results.append(counter),
        globals().__setitem__('temp', counter + 1),
        time.sleep(0.001)  # Simulate race condition
    )[1]
    
    threads = []
    for _ in range(100):
        t = threading.Thread(target=increment)
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()
    
    for t in threads:
        t.join()
    
    # Results will be inconsistent due to race conditions
    print(f"Expected: 100, Got: {len(set(results))} unique values")

# Run it multiple times to see different results
for i in range(5):
    unsafe_counter_example()
```

### Scenario 3: **Lambda with Non-Atomic Operations** ❌
```python
import threading

# Non-atomic operations in lambda
shared_list = []

# ❌ Not thread-safe: list operations aren't atomic
append_lambda = lambda x: shared_list.append(x)

def test_non_atomic():
    threads = []
    for i in range(1000):
        t = threading.Thread(target=lambda: append_lambda(i))
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()
    
    for t in threads:
        t.join()
    
    # Length might not be 1000 due to race conditions
    print(f"List length: {len(shared_list)} (should be 1000)")
```

## 🧪 Detailed Thread Safety Tests

### Test 1: Lambda with Global Variable Access
```python
import threading
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import random

global_counter = 0

def test_global_access():
    """Demonstrates race condition with global variable."""
    global global_counter
    
    # ❌ NOT thread-safe: multiple threads read-modify-write
    unsafe_increment = lambda: (
        current := global_counter,
        time.sleep(random.uniform(0, 0.001)),  # Increase race window
        globals().__setitem__('global_counter', current + 1)
    )
    
    # ✅ Thread-safe version with locking
    lock = threading.Lock()
    safe_increment = lambda: (
        lock.acquire(),
        current := global_counter,
        time.sleep(random.uniform(0, 0.001)),
        globals().__setitem__('global_counter', current + 1),
        lock.release()
    )
    
    def run_test(lambda_func, label):
        global global_counter
        global_counter = 0
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
            futures = [executor.submit(lambda_func) for _ in range(100)]
            [f.result() for f in futures]
        print(f"{label}: {global_counter} (expected: 100)")

    run_test(unsafe_increment, "Unsafe lambda")
    run_test(safe_increment, "Safe lambda with lock")
```

### Test 2: Lambda with Complex Shared State
```python
import threading
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Dict, List

@dataclass
class SharedState:
    data: Dict[str, int] = field(default_factory=dict)
    log: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)

def test_complex_state():
    """Lambda accessing multiple shared mutable objects."""
    state = SharedState()
    
    # ❌ Highly unsafe: multiple shared mutable objects
    unsafe_operation = lambda key, value: (
        state.data.update({key: value}),
        state.log.append(f"Set {key}={value}"),
        # Reading while writing creates inconsistencies
        len(state.data) != len(state.log)  # Might be True due to race
    )
    
    # Thread-safe version
    lock = threading.RLock()  # Reentrant lock for nested operations
    
    def safe_operation(key, value):
        with lock:
            state.data[key] = value
            state.log.append(f"Set {key}={value}")
            return len(state.data) == len(state.log)
    
    # Convert to lambda with lock (still need careful design)
    safe_lambda = lambda key, value: safe_operation(key, value)
    
    # Test both
    def run_threads(operation, name):
        state.data.clear()
        state.log.clear()
        
        threads = []
        for i in range(50):
            t = threading.Thread(
                target=operation,
                args=(f"key_{i}", i)
            )
            threads.append(t)
            t.start()
        
        for t in threads:
            t.join()
        
        print(f"{name}: data_len={len(state.data)}, log_len={len(state.log)}")
        print(f"  Consistency check: {len(state.data) == len(state.log)}")
    
    run_threads(unsafe_operation, "Unsafe lambda")
    run_threads(safe_lambda, "Safe lambda")
```

## 🎯 Lambda Thread Safety Rules

### **Thread-Safe Lambda** (Green Light ✅):
```python
# 1. Pure functions (no side effects)
safe1 = lambda x: x * 2
safe2 = lambda a, b: a + b

# 2. Immutable operations on arguments
safe3 = lambda s: s.upper()  # Returns new string
safe4 = lambda lst: tuple(lst)  # Creates new tuple

# 3. Calling other thread-safe functions
import math
safe5 = lambda x: math.sqrt(x)  # math functions are thread-safe

# 4. Using immutable captured variables
IMMUTABLE_CONSTANT = 100
safe6 = lambda x: x + IMMUTABLE_CONSTANT  # Capturing immutable global
```

### **NOT Thread-Safe Lambda** (Red Light ❌):
```python
# 1. Modifying captured mutable variables
counter = 0
unsafe1 = lambda: counter += 1  # Actually syntax error, but conceptually unsafe

# 2. Performing I/O operations without synchronization
unsafe2 = lambda msg: open('log.txt', 'a').write(msg)  # File race conditions

# 3. Calling non-thread-safe functions
unsafe_dict = {}
unsafe3 = lambda k, v: unsafe_dict.update({k: v})  # Dict operations aren't atomic

# 4. Multiple operations that should be atomic
shared_list = []
unsafe4 = lambda x: (
    shared_list.append(x),
    len(shared_list)  # Race between append and len
)
```

## 🛡️ Making Lambdas Thread-Safe

### Strategy 1: **Avoid Shared State**
```python
# Instead of capturing mutable state, pass everything as arguments
def create_thread_safe_lambda():
    """Factory that creates stateless lambdas."""
    # All state is passed in, nothing captured
    return lambda x, constant: x + constant

safe_lambda = create_thread_safe_lambda()
# Can be safely used across threads
```

### Strategy 2: **Use Thread-Local Storage**
```python
import threading

# Each thread gets its own copy of data
thread_local = threading.local()

def initialize_thread_data():
    thread_local.counter = 0

# Lambda using thread-local data (safe for per-thread state)
thread_safe_counter = lambda: (
    setattr(thread_local, 'counter', getattr(thread_local, 'counter', 0) + 1),
    thread_local.counter
)[1]

# Each thread increments its own counter independently
```

### Strategy 3: **Synchronization with Locks**
```python
import threading
from functools import wraps
from typing import Any, Callable

def synchronized(lock: threading.Lock):
    """Decorator to make lambdas thread-safe."""
    def decorator(func: Callable) -> Callable:
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs) -> Any:
            with lock:
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

# Create a thread-safe lambda
shared_data = []
lock = threading.Lock()

# Wrap lambda with synchronization
safe_append = synchronized(lock)(lambda x: shared_data.append(x))

# Now safe to use across threads
```

### Strategy 4: **Functional Approach (Immutable Data)**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import threading

# Instead of modifying, always return new data
def immutable_operations():
    """Using immutable data structures and pure functions."""
    
    # Original immutable data
    original = (1, 2, 3)  # Tuple is immutable
    
    # Pure lambda - always returns new tuple
    add_element = lambda tpl, elem: tpl + (elem,)
    
    # Safe to use in multiple threads
    results = []
    lock = threading.Lock()  # Only for result collection
    
    def worker(tpl, elem):
        new_tpl = add_element(tpl, elem)  # Thread-safe operation
        with lock:
            results.append(new_tpl)
    
    threads = []
    for i in range(10):
        t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(original, i))
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()
    
    for t in threads:
        t.join()
    
    return results
```

## 📈 Real-World Examples and Patterns

### Example 1: **Thread-Safe Counter with Lambda**
```python
import threading
from typing import Callable
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

class ThreadSafeCounter:
    """Thread-safe counter using lambda with lock."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self._value = 0
        self._lock = threading.Lock()
    
    @property
    def increment(self) -> Callable[[], int]:
        """Returns a thread-safe increment lambda."""
        return lambda: (
            self._lock.acquire(),
            setattr(self, '_value', self._value + 1),
            current := self._value,
            self._lock.release(),
            current
        )[2]
    
    @property
    def get_value(self) -> Callable[[], int]:
        """Returns a thread-safe getter lambda."""
        return lambda: (
            self._lock.acquire(),
            value := self._value,
            self._lock.release(),
            value
        )[1]

# Usage
counter = ThreadSafeCounter()

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(counter.increment) for _ in range(1000)]
    results = [f.result() for f in futures]

print(f"Final counter value: {counter.get_value()()}")
print(f"All increments successful: {len(results) == 1000}")
```

### Example 2: **Lambda in Thread Pool Processing**
```python
import concurrent.futures
from typing import List, Any

def process_data_threadsafe(data: List[Any]) -> List[Any]:
    """
    Thread-safe data processing using pure lambdas.
    Each lambda is self-contained with no shared state.
    """
    
    # Pure processing lambdas (thread-safe)
    processors = [
        lambda x: x * 2,                    # Pure operation
        lambda x: str(x).zfill(3),          # Pure string operation
        lambda x: {'value': x, 'sq': x*x},  # Creates new dict
    ]
    
    def process_item(item: Any) -> Any:
        """Apply all processors to an item."""
        result = item
        for processor in processors:
            result = processor(result)
        return result
    
    # Process in parallel - safe because process_item uses only pure lambdas
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(process_item, item) for item in data]
        results = [f.result() for f in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures)]
    
    return results

# Test
data = list(range(10))
results = process_data_threadsafe(data)
print(f"Processed {len(results)} items safely")
```

### Example 3: **Dangerous Anti-Pattern**
```python
import threading
import time

# ⚠️ ANTI-PATTERN: Lambda with race condition
def dangerous_pattern():
    """Shows how lambdas can create subtle threading bugs."""
    
    results = []
    
    # ❌ Appears simple but has hidden race condition
    for i in range(5):
        # Lambda captures loop variable 'i' (late binding issue)
        t = threading.Thread(
            target=lambda: (
                time.sleep(0.1 * i),  # Different sleep times
                results.append(i)      # All threads see final value of i!
            )
        )
        t.start()
        t.join()
    
    print(f"Results: {results}")  # Might be [4, 4, 4, 4, 4] not [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    
    # ✅ Fix: Capture current value with default argument
    results_fixed = []
    for i in range(5):
        t = threading.Thread(
            target=lambda i=i: (  # Capture current i value
                time.sleep(0.1 * i),
                results_fixed.append(i)
            )
        )
        t.start()
        t.join()
    
    print(f"Fixed results: {results_fixed}")  # Correct: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## 🔬 Advanced Analysis: Python GIL and Lambdas

### GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) Impact
```python
"""
Python's GIL ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time.
This affects lambda thread safety in complex ways:
"""

import threading
import sys

def gil_impact_on_lambdas():
    """Demonstrates GIL's effect on lambda thread safety."""
    
    # CPU-bound lambda (affected by GIL)
    cpu_bound = lambda x: sum(i*i for i in range(x))
    
    # I/O bound lambda (less affected by GIL during I/O)
    import requests
    io_bound = lambda url: len(requests.get(url).text)
    
    """
    Key Insights:
    1. GIL prevents true parallelism for CPU-bound lambdas
    2. I/O operations release GIL, allowing concurrency
    3. Race conditions can still occur during GIL releases
    4. Thread safety ≠ parallelism
    
    For CPU-bound work, consider:
    - multiprocessing instead of threading
    - asyncio for I/O bound work
    - C extensions that release GIL
    """
```

## 📋 Thread Safety Checklist for Lambdas

Ask these questions about your lambda:

1. **❓ Does it access any non-local variables?**
   - No → Likely thread-safe ✅
   - Yes → Continue to question 2

2. **❓ Are accessed variables immutable?**
   - Yes → Likely thread-safe ✅  
   - No → Continue to question 3

3. **❓ Does it modify shared mutable state?**
   - No → Likely thread-safe ✅
   - Yes → NOT thread-safe ❌ (needs synchronization)

4. **❓ Does it perform I/O operations?**
   - No → Check other factors
   - Yes → Needs proper synchronization ❌

5. **❓ Are operations atomic?**
   - Yes → Possibly thread-safe ✅ (but verify)
   - No → NOT thread-safe ❌

## 🎓 Summary and Best Practices

### **When Lambda IS Thread-Safe:**
1. **Pure functions** with no side effects
2. **Immutable operations** on arguments only
3. **No captured mutable state**
4. **Deterministic** (same input → same output)
5. **No I/O operations** or external dependencies

### **When Lambda is NOT Thread-Safe:**
1. **Modifies shared mutable state**
2. **Performs non-atomic operations** on shared data
3. **Has side effects** (file I/O, network calls)
4. **Depends on external mutable state**
5. **Uses non-thread-safe libraries**

### **Golden Rules:**
1. **Assume lambdas are NOT thread-safe** unless proven otherwise
2. **Document thread safety** assumptions in code
3. **Test with concurrent access** during development
4. **Prefer immutability** and pure functions
5. **Use synchronization** when sharing mutable state

**So, lambda functions are NOT always thread-safe.** Their thread safety depends entirely on:
- Whether they access shared mutable state
- Whether their operations are atomic
- Whether they have side effects
- The thread safety of any functions they call
