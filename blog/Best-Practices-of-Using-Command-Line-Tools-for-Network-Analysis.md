## Introduction

Network analysis is a critical skill for system administrators and network engineers. Command line tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, `netstat`, `tcpdump`, `nmap`, `iftop`, and `wireshark` provide powerful capabilities for monitoring, diagnosing, and troubleshooting network issues. This article provides a comprehensive guide to the best practices of using these tools, covering various scenarios such as capturing and filtering network traffic, displaying network statistics, and diagnosing network issues.

## Basic Network Analysis

### <a name="ping"></a> Ping

To check connectivity to a host, use the `ping` command:

```bash
ping google.com
```

This command sends ICMP echo requests to the specified host and displays the response time.

### <a name="traceroute"></a> Traceroute

To trace the route to a host, use the `traceroute` command:

```bash
traceroute google.com
```

This command shows the path packets take to reach the specified host.

### <a name="netstat"></a> Netstat

To display network statistics and active connections, use the `netstat` command:

```bash
netstat -a
```

This command displays all active connections and listening ports.

### <a name="netcat"></a> Netcat

To test network connections and transfer data, use the `nc` (netcat) command:

```bash
nc -zv google.com 80
```

This command checks if port 80 is open on `google.com`.

## Advanced Network Analysis

### <a name="tcpdump"></a> Tcpdump

To capture and analyze network traffic, use the `tcpdump` command:

```bash
tcpdump -i eth0
```

This command captures all traffic on the `eth0` interface.

### <a name="wireshark"></a> Wireshark

To capture and analyze network traffic with a graphical interface, use `wireshark`:

```bash
wireshark
```

This tool provides advanced filtering and analysis capabilities.

### <a name="nmap"></a> Nmap

To scan for open ports and services on a host, use the `nmap` command:

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.1
```

This command scans the specified IP address for open ports and services.

### <a name="iftop"></a> Iftop

To monitor network traffic in real-time, use the `iftop` command:

```bash
iftop -i eth0
```

This command displays real-time network traffic on the `eth0` interface.

<a name="combining-commands"></a>
## Combining Commands

### <a name="using-grep-with-tcpdump"></a> Using `grep` with `tcpdump`

To filter `tcpdump` output, use `grep`:

```bash
tcpdump -i eth0 | grep "HTTP"
```

This command filters `tcpdump` output to show only HTTP traffic.

### <a name="using-awk-with-netstat"></a> Using `awk` with `netstat`

To process `netstat` output, use `awk`:

```bash
netstat -an | awk '/:80 / {print $5}'
```

This command extracts the IP addresses of connections on port 80.

### <a name="using-sed-with-nmap"></a> Using `sed` with `nmap`

To process `nmap` output, use `sed`:

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.1 | sed -n '/open/p'
```

This command filters `nmap` output to show only open ports.

<a name="advanced-scenarios"></a>
## Advanced Scenarios

### <a name="analyzing-http-traffic"></a> Analyzing HTTP Traffic

To capture and analyze HTTP traffic, use `tcpdump` with port filtering:

```bash
tcpdump -i eth0 port 80
```

### <a name="monitoring-real-time-traffic"></a> Monitoring Real-Time Traffic

To monitor real-time traffic on a specific interface, use `iftop`:

```bash
iftop -i eth0
```

### <a name="diagnosing-network-issues"></a> Diagnosing Network Issues

To diagnose network issues, use a combination of `ping`, `traceroute`, and `tcpdump`:

```bash
ping google.com
traceroute google.com
tcpdump -i eth0 host google.com
```
